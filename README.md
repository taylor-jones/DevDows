# DevDows

##### Simple Windows desktop wrapper of [DevDocs](http://devdocs.io) using Electron
##### Inspired by [DevDogs](https://github.com/ragingwind/devdogs) (for OS X) - I decided to make a version for Windows.

##### I have no affiliation with DevDocs. I just really like using it.

### To use, just download, extract (and place the extracted folder wherever you want), and run the .exe.
