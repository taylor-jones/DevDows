# DevDows

##### Unofficial Windows desktop version of [DevDocs](http://devdocs.io) using Electron
##### Inspired by [DevDogs](https://github.com/ragingwind/devdogs) - this is a version for Windows

##### I have no affiliation with DevDocs. I just really like using it.

### To use, just download, extract (and place the extracted folder wherever you want), and run the .exe.
