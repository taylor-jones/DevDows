# DevDows

A simple Windows desktop wrapper of [DevDocs](http://devdocs.io) using Electron
Inspired by [DevDogs](https://github.com/ragingwind/devdogs) (for OS X) - I decided to make a version for Windows.

I have no affiliation with DevDocs. I just really like using it.
To use, just download, extract (and place the extracted folder wherever you want), and run the .exe.


#### Note: There now exists an easier way to get DevDocs for desktop, [here](https://github.com/egoist/devdocs-desktop/releases/tag/v0.6.9).
